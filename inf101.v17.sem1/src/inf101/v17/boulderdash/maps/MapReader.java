/**
 * A class to read a Boulder Dash map from a file. After the file is read, the
 * map is stored as an {@link #IGrid} whose entries are characters. This can
 * then be used to be passed to the constructor in {@link #BDMap}.
 * 
 * The first line of the file should could contain two numbers. First the width
 * and then the height of the map. After that follows a matrix of characters
 * describing which object goes where in the map. '*' for wall, ' ' for empty,
 * 'P' for the player, 'b' for a bug, 'r' for a rock, and '#' for sand. For
 * example
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * 5 6
 * *## p
 * * rr#
 * *####
 * *   *
 * *   d
 *    b 
 * }
 * </pre>
